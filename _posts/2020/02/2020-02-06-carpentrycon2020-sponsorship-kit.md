The [CarpentryCon 2020 Taskforce](https://2020.carpentrycon.org/task-force/) is excited to be planning the 2nd CarpentryCon that [will be held](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/07/carpentrycon2020-theme-venue/) on June 29 - July 1st 2020 at the [University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA](https://www.wisc.edu/)! The [Budget Subcommittee](https://2020.carpentrycon.org/task-force/) has been working to develop a sponsorship kit to share with the community to solicit your support. 

We know that the cost of the conference to community members, i.e. registration, airfare, hotel, etcâ€¦, is just as important as the location. We want to ensure that you have the greatest experience at the lowest rate possible. To do so, the Budget Subcommittee has developed a [Sponsorship Model](https://2020.carpentrycon.org/sponsorship/) to allow  organizations and individuals to contribute financially to CarpentryCon 2020!

#How you can help

One of the incredible strengths of this community is our diversity; there are organisations and individuals in our networks who would be proud to support CarpentryCon 2020, and the Budget Subcommittee needs your help finding them!

##Start the Conversation
The Budget Subcommittee created a [Sponsorship Kit](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u-CXe50hYcDPCd90Ubr8d7S3sQYoDK5Y) that contains all the information you need to begin the conversation to encourage people to complete the  [sponsorship application](https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/hqoY3I). The kit contains the following:

**Becoming a sponsor letter**: use this templated email as the initial contact to the potential donor. There are areas for you to add your personal touch. You are welcome to adjust this letter to your needs
**Annual Report**: will provide additional information about [The Carpentries](carpentries.org/)
**Sponsorship Tiers**: will outline all of the available ways to be a sponsor and list the benefits. 
*We do not expect you to cold call people. Only reach out to people you already have connections with.* 

##Be a Resource
 
If you are uncomfortable emailing people and would still like to help, there are other ways you can help. If you would prefer us to contact them and share the benefits of becoming a sponsor, please complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ftw8g-f2A8Oaxpeaz_0uOisP8Mn0lDpMpvI1TKTDOLw/edit). 

Lastly, we have compiled a [list of potential sponsors](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yWARRlcBX7Q05uIG_Mtx_MHRBLcSfCHH-YLVgdOkMPU/edit#gid=0) we will be contacting. If you have any additional companies you would like to add, please email <carpentrycon-budget@lists.carpentries.org>. 

We [value](https://carpentries.org/values/) *Community Collaboration* and *All Contributions*! So we hope to execute another great CarpentryCon with your support.
